                Founded in 2025, our platform was born out of a vision to bridge the gap between high-quality education and learners worldwide.
                We noticed that many learners struggled to find practical, skill-based courses that fit their schedules.

            <p className='para'>
                Starting as a small team of educators and technologists, we focused on creating a platform that is intuitive, flexible, and learner-friendly.
                Today, thousands of learners trust us to provide courses that are relevant, engaging, and effective.
